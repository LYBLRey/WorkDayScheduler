# <WorkDayScheduler>

Calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Utilizing Moment.js

## Description

This project solves the problem of needing to plan a work day out, with a clear, organized, hourly planner.
I learned that using more id's, I am able to save the information within html cells (tr, td, th)
